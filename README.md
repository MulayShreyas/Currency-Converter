The Currency Converter Web App is a simple and user-friendly web application designed to convert currencies based on real-time exchange rates. This app leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end development and uses an external API to fetch current exchange rates. The application is hosted on GitHub, where users can access the source code, report issues, and contribute to the project.

## Features

  1) **Real-Time Conversion**: Fetches the latest exchange rates from a reliable API.
  2) **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy navigation.
  3) **Multiple Currency Support**: Supports conversion between multiple international currencies.
  4) **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
  5) **Open Source**: Hosted on GitHub for transparency and community contribution.

## Technologies Used

  1) **HTML**: Structure and content of the web app.
  2) **CSS**: Styling and layout to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design.
  3) **JavaScript**: Core logic for fetching data and handling user interactions.
  4) **External API**: Integration with a currency exchange rate API (e.g., OpenExchangeRates, Fixer.io) to fetch real-time data.

## How It Works

  **User Input**: The user selects the currencies they wish to convert from and to, and enters the amount to be converted.
    
  **API Call**: The app makes an asynchronous request to the external API to fetch the latest exchange rates.
  
  **Conversion**: The fetched data is used to calculate the converted amount based on the user's input.
    
  **Display Result**: The converted amount is displayed to the user in a clean and readable format.
